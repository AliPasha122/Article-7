Household odors remain a persistent and frustrating problem in daily life, affecting comfort
and indoor air quality. Whether it's lingering smells from cooking, pet odors, or general
mustiness, traditional solutions such as air fresheners, scented candles, and ventilation
systems provide only temporary relief by masking rather than eliminating the root cause.
Despite advancements in air purification and chemical science, a long-term, energy-efficient,
and eco-friendly solution to odor removal has yet to be widely adopted.
Leveraging advancements in nanotechnology, the use of nanostructured metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) and photocatalytic materials offers a groundbreaking solution for long-
lasting, efficient odor removal.
